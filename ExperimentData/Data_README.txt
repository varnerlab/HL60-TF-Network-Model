Each of these files contains a matrix that represents a experimental taken from a single experiment in the literature. 

The columns of each matrix corresponds to:

[TIME VALUE ERROR DESIGN SPECIES]

TIME = the time point(s) of the measurement(s). This is 0 if measurements were taken at steady state.

VALUE = the intensity of the blot at that particular time point. These were measured using ImageJ

ERROR = the error associated with that measurement. They are absolute values, not percent. Errors were assumed to be 10 percent of the measurement unless otherwise specified by the article.

DESIGN = Experimental design simulations required by this experimental data

SPECIES = Species measured starting at 0
